- Competitor comparison logic
- Generates gaps, advantages, and critical actions
- Calculates competitive score
- Provides detailed technical and content gap analysis

#### generateAIReport(yourAnalysis, competitorAnalysis, comparison, targetKeyword, isPillarPost)
- Creates formatted markdown report for AI assistants
- Includes all analysis data and specific recommendations

## API REQUEST/RESPONSE STRUCTURE

### Request Body:
```json
{
  "url": "https://yoursite.com/page",
  "targetKeyword": "septic software",
  "competitorUrl": "https://competitor.com/page", // optional
  "isPillarPost": true // optional
}
```

### Response Structure:
```json
{
  "analysis": { /* Your page analysis */ },
  "competitor": { /* Competitor analysis */ }, // if provided
  "comparison": { /* Competitive comparison */ }, // if competitor provided
  "aiReport": "Formatted markdown report for AI assistants"
}
```

## KEY FEATURES EXPLAINED

### Smart Keyword Matching
- Handles partial matches: "Septic Software" matches "Septic Business Software"
- Ignores short words ("a", "the", etc.)
- Provides both exact and partial density percentages
- Shows match quality (exact vs partial) in UI

### Competitor Analysis Specificity
- Shows exact heading gaps: "H2: 12 vs your 6"
- Lists competitor's actual H2 topics for content ideas
- Details missing technical elements: "Missing: Open Graph tags, Canonical URL"
- Provides specific recommendations: "Consider adding sections about: Pricing, Features"

### Prioritization System
- Critical: Must fix immediately (missing H1, title, meta description)
- High: Fix this week (keyword optimization, major gaps)
- Medium: Fix this month (technical improvements, schema)
- Low: Nice to have (performance optimizations)

### Pillar Post Differences
- Content requirements: 2000+ words vs 300+
- Internal linking: 10+ links vs 3+
- H2 sections: 8-15 vs 3+
- Keyword density: 0.8%+ vs 0.5%+

## DEPLOYMENT

### Railway Configuration
- Uses railway.json for build configuration
- npm run build for React build process
- npm start runs Express server
- Environment: Node.js 18.x

### Package.json Scripts
- start: "node server.js" (production)
- build: "react-scripts build" (React build)
- dev: Local development with concurrently

## COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Build Failures
- Issue: Function called before definition
- Solution: Moved calculateReadabilityScore before usage
- Issue: Unused variables in React
- Solution: Removed unused competitor variable

### Frontend Errors
- Issue: Object.entries on undefined
- Solution: Added null checks (analysis.headings || {})
- Issue: API error handling
- Solution: Check data.error before processing

### Icon Issues
- Issue: FileText icon not found
- Solution: Changed to basic File icon from lucide-react
